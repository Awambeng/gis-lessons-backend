# Rust Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate for Rust projects. It includes a basic project structure, a Makefile for common tasks, and a
Dockerfile for building and running the project in a container.


## Getting Started
1. Generate server and client code from the OpenAPI spec:
   ```bash
   make init
   ```
   
2. Start the project:
   ```bash
   make up-app
   ```
